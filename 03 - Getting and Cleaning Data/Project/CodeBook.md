The returned dataset of run_analysis includes 81 variables.

Variables which describe the subject (1-30) and activity (laying, sitting, standing, walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs):
 [1] "Subject"                                                  
 [2] "Activity"

Variables which show the calculated average mean or standard deviation of measurements by subject/activity in the XYZ axises and time/frequency domain signals:
